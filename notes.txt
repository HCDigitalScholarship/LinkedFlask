here are just some notes for where to learn about stuff for the project:

the form that we will use can be explained here:
http://tutorialspoint.com/flask/flask_wtf.htm

we will need to make a form for each type of search
- travels
-letters
-people

To determine what fields each of these forms will need see the ld_old/Linked_Data.html ( the old form) 
or what is on the homepage currently. 

NOTE: People is pretty much done. 
NOTE: Letters involves a conditional validator-- either wrote or recieved must be validated ( also both is a possiblility)
i think this will help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8463209/how-to-make-a-field-conditionally-optional-in-wtforms
